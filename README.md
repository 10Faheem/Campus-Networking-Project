# Campus-Networking-Project

Design and simulate a comprehensive network infrastructure for a medium-sized campus network. This project includes multiple VLANs, OSPF and RIP routing protocols, and various network security measures. Developed as part of the DATA COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING LAB course under Instructor Mohsin Javaid Butt, Spring 2024.

## Overview

This repository contains the files and configurations for the campus networking project. The objective was to design, implement, and simulate a robust, secure, and efficient network that meets the operational needs of a medium-sized campus environment.

## Project Components

### Network Design

- **Basic Network Layout**: Developed a foundational network layout with appropriate cable types and an IPv4 addressing scheme.
- **Peer-to-Peer Network Setup**: Expanded the network by adding switches and routers, configured via CLI, connecting multiple LANs.
- **Router and Switch Configuration**: Established console sessions, managed configurations using HyperTerminal, and implemented backup solutions with TFTP servers.
- **VLAN and VTP Configuration**: Designed and implemented multiple VLANs, configured VTP modes for VLAN distribution and security.
- **Routing Protocols**: Implemented RIP and OSPF for efficient inter-VLAN routing and network scalability.
- **DHCP Server Simulation**: Simulated packet motion through a DHCP server to analyze data flow and troubleshoot issues.

### Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For simulation and analysis of network traffic, performance, and security.

## Features

- **IP Addressing Scheme**: Utilized IPv4 addressing for all devices in the network.
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured RIP and OSPF to ensure efficient and scalable routing.
- **VLANs and VTP Security**: Implemented multiple VLANs with VTP configurations for secure and segmented network traffic.
- **Backup Solutions**: Used TFTP servers for configuration backups.
- **Network Analysis**: Simulated and analyzed real-world network traffic and performance.

## Deliverables

- **Detailed Project Report**: Includes network diagrams, IP addressing schemes, configurations, and security measures.
- **Simulated Network**: A fully simulated network in Cisco Packet Tracer demonstrating the working and security of the network.
- **Presentation/Video Demonstration**: A short video showcasing the network design, features, and a walkthrough of the configuration.
